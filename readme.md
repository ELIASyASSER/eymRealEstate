## Installation and Usage
after creating mongodb and cloudinary accounts like i mention on  [description](#description)
you will fork my repo  code HTTPS =>copy url 
go to open your **cmd** `git clone url`
now you will find 3 dirs client and server and socket open your terminal create 3 terminals for each dir cd client on the first terminal and cd server and cd socket on other terminals run `npm install` in each terminal on the `api` termianl run npx prisma db push to push schema to your db
you will find **.env.example** files please rename them to .env and fill the data inside 

but now you can't see any posts so to generate dummy data 
there is a file inside `api` called `seeds.js`
you should open 4'th terminal `cd api` run `npm run seed` or `node seeds.js` this will generate dummy data for you that you can see your website  

finally run `npm run dev` in each directory `api` and `client` and `socket`

Enjoy .... `http://localhost:5173`
